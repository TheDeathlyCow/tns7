These loot tables have been modified from their vanilla versions for Season 7 of TNS.

# Blocks

* Iron ore and deepslate iron ore no longer respect the Fortune enchantment. They will always drop 1 raw iron, unless mined with silk touch.

# Entities

* The Husk now has a 20% chance (increases with looting) to drop 1 sand (also increases with looting). If the Husk is killed in a Badlands, Eroded Badlands, or Wooded Badlands biome, then it will drop red sand instead.

* Iron Golems will only drop iron if they are built by a player.
