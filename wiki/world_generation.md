This is a hopefully comprehensive guide to world generation changes for Season 7 of TNS.

# Overworld

## Entity Spawning

* Husks now spawn in badlands biomes.

## New Structures

* Husk dungeons now spawn in desert and badlands biomes, with a greater number of them spawning below `y = 0`.

# The End

## Structures

### End city

Because End Cities can only generate in End Highlands biomes, and not in any of the new biomes, the density of End Cities has been slightly increased to compensate for decreased potential spawning areas.

### Altar

## Biomes

In The End, the 5 noise parameters have slightly different meanings. Temperature, humidity, and weirdness still have the same meanings as they do in the Overworld. However, "continentalness" is now "creepiness" and "erosion" is now "magical potential".

### End Barrens

### End Highlands

### Ender Grove

### Enderius Fields

### Petrified Forest

### Weeping Deltas
