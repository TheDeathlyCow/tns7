This is a hopefully comprehensive guide to world generation changes for **Season 7 of TNS**.

# Overworld

## Entity Spawning

* Husks now spawn in badlands biomes.

## New Structures

* Husk dungeons now spawn in desert and badlands biomes, with a greater number of them spawning below `y = 0`.

# The End

## The Dragon's Nest

The Ender Dragon fight has received some changes, mainly in appearance. The Ender Dragon's maximum health has been substantially increased, and the island has undergone some major changes (mainly to make it look prettier, but also to make the fight harder). All of the end crystals are now encased in stained glass, and so players must climb the pillars to destroy them. The End Crystals also regenerate after 60 seconds. The ground is much more shattered, making movement around the island more difficult.

* Note: These changes are not present in the datapack included in the source of this repository.

## Outer-Island Biomes

The End now features several new biomes, detailed below, that generate naturally within the world. The islands are still shaped the same as always, however now they are now decorated with 4 new biomes (and 2 old ones). The biomes generate using the multinoise settings, similar to the Overworld and The Nether. However, the centre island was pre-generated prior to the opening of The End and still has the standard `the_end` biome in it. If you use this datapack in a fresh single player world, you will get some random biomes in the centre island. As of 1.18.2, the outer end biomes include generation from [Nullscape](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/nullscape/) by Starmute.

In The End, the 5 noise parameters have slightly different meanings. Temperature, humidity, and weirdness still have the same meanings as they do in the Overworld. However, "continentalness" is now "creepiness" and "erosion" is now "magical potential".

### Terrain shape

As of 1.18.2, the server will be using Nullscape for custom end terrain shape generation. You will be able to find massive islands stretching over the entire height limit with mountains, valleys, and caves dotted throughout. 

### End Highlands

The End Highlands are filled with Chorus, and are also the home of the elusive End Cities. There are a couple of new features added to this biome by Nullscape, but it is otherwise unmodified. Be careful, and good luck on your hunt for Elytra!

### Ender Grove

A place of rest, the Ender Grove provides sanctuary to all those weary travelers in need. It is said that the trees create a healing mist that can treat any wound. However, this biome is quite rare only a lucky few have ever seen it.

### Enderius Fields

The Enderius Fields are the home of the Endermite, who are able to survive in the pools that their primary predator, the Endermen, dare not touch. In the fields you will also find pools of a magical, purple liquid called Enderius that Sculk Sensors thrive in. However, be careful, Enderius is toxic and the Sculk Sensors are known to attempt to defend themselves from predators.

### Petrified Forest

Scorched by Dragon Fire, this desolate forest may have once been thriving with life. Now all that is left are the charred remains of the trees that once grew here. The magma scars found in the biome make excellent nests for the Magma Cubes who call this place home. And be sure to bring a mask with you, as the air is thick with falling ash.

### Weeping Deltas

This magical biome is the source of all sadness in the world. The pillars of Crying Obsidian are able to pull Ghasts from The Nether, imprisoning them in this empty void for the rest of time. Their tears mix with the ancient basalt to form crystals of amethyst on the ground.

A few unlucky Ghasts are some imprisoned by the Endermen here. It is unknown what the Endermen want with them, but perhaps it would be best to let them go...

## Nullscape Biomes

The following biomes were added or modified by Nullscape. Information about them is included here for your convencience. 

### Shadowlands

The home of the Phantom, this eery place is not very welcoming to outsiders.

### Crystal Peaks

These lofty peaks are home to living bridges of amethyst. While they may not appear to be a living thing, similar to coral here on Earth, these bioluminescent bridges are very much alive and can feel every swing of your pickaxe digging into them.

### End Midlands 

A dark barren wasteland, typically forming the foot hills of the Crystal Peaks. Not much is to be found here, unless you're a fan of blackstone, I suppose.
